# Closed Positions Summary Sheet

The Closed Positions Summary sheet provides an aggregated overview of all your closed investment positions across equities, cryptocurrencies, and options. It automatically calculates and displays key metrics for each asset where you have fully closed positions (i.e., assets you no longer own or have settled contracts for). This sheet is generated by the add-on based on your Trades sheet and closed price data, offering a historical snapshot of your portfolio's performance for tax reporting, analysis, or review.

## Purpose and How It Works

- **Aggregation**: The sheet summarizes data for assets with closed positions, pulling from your Trades sheet. It does not include open positions or assets without closed trades.
- **Year Filtering**: Use the "Year" dropdown in the header to filter data by the year the positions were closed. By default, it includes 2023, 2024, and 2025, but you can add more years by selecting the dropdown, going to **Data > Data Validation**, and editing the list.
- **Visibility Control**: An asset only appears in this summary if the "In Summary" checkbox is ticked in the Assets Configuration section of the Configuration sheet. If an asset is missing, check this setting.
- **Asset Types**:
  - For equities, it aggregates data for both sold shares and settled options contracts.
  - For cryptocurrencies, it focuses on coins with closed positions.
- **Automatic Updates**: The sheet refreshes when you run "Generate trades". It uses historical data for accuracy.

## Key Columns

The sheet includes columns for essential metrics, similar to the Open Positions Summary. Values are shown in both the asset's native currency and your base currency (set in the Configuration sheet) for multi-currency portfolios.

:::info
If all your assets are in the same currency as your base currency, the "b. curr." (base currency) columns will be redundant. You can hide them by right-clicking the column headers and selecting "Hide column" to simplify the view.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Historical Analysis**: Use this sheet to review past performance. Filter by year to focus on specific periods for tax filings or strategy evaluation.
- **Currency Handling**: For multi-currency portfolios, rely on the "b. curr." columns for accurate historical comparisons. Ensure exchange rates were correct at the time of closing.
- **Troubleshooting Missing Assets**: If an expected asset isn't listed, verify the "In Summary" checkbox in Assets Configuration and that you have closed positions (run "Generate trades" to refresh).
- **Data Accuracy**: This sheet uses data from closed trades; for live updates, refer to the Open Positions Summary.
- **Integration with Other Sheets**: For detailed trade history, refer to the Trades sheet. This summary can help populate tax reports.

This sheet is essential for reviewing closed positions—use it for year-end summaries or performance audits.
