# Open Positions Summary Sheet

The Open Positions Summary sheet provides an aggregated overview of all your open investment positions across equities, cryptocurrencies, and options. It automatically calculates and displays key metrics for each asset where you have an outstanding position (i.e., assets you still own or have open contracts for). This sheet is generated by the add-on based on your Trades sheet and live price updates, offering a high-level snapshot of your portfolio's performance.

## Purpose and How It Works

- **Aggregation**: The sheet summarizes data for assets with open positions, pulling from your Trades sheet and live price updates. It does not include closed positions or assets without open trades.
- **Visibility Control**: An asset only appears in this summary if the "In Summary" checkbox is ticked in the Assets Configuration section of the Configuration sheet. If an asset is missing, check this setting.
- **Asset Types**:
  - For equities, it aggregates data for both owned shares and open options contracts.
  - For cryptocurrencies, it focuses on coins with open positions.
- **Automatic Updates**: The sheet refreshes when you run "Generate trades" or update prices via the Portfolio Tracker menu. It reflects real-time data where available.

## Key Columns

The sheet includes columns for essential metrics. Values are shown in both the asset's native currency and your base currency (set in the Configuration sheet) for multi-currency portfolios.

If all your assets are in the same currency as your base currency, the "b. curr." (base currency) columns will be redundant. You can hide them by right-clicking the column headers and selecting "Hide column" to simplify the view.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Monitoring Performance**: Use this sheet to quickly assess which assets are profitable or need attention. Sort by P&L or ROI to identify top performers.
- **Currency Handling**: For multi-currency portfolios, rely on the "b. curr." columns for accurate comparisons. Ensure exchange rates are up-to-date in the Transactions sheet.
- **Troubleshooting Missing Assets**: If an expected asset isn't listed, verify the "In Summary" checkbox in Assets Configuration and that you have open positions (run "Generate trades" to refresh).
- **Data Accuracy**: Prices are updated via "Update prices" in the menu. For manual overrides, edit the Current Price column in Assets Configuration.
- **Integration with Other Sheets**: This summary feeds into the Dashboard for visualizations. For detailed trade history, refer to the Trades sheet.

This sheet is essential for portfolio oversight—review it regularly to stay informed on your open positions.
