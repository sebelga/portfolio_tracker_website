          Terms and Services – Portfolio Tracker
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Effective Date: September 21, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to the Portfolio Tracker Add-on (the "Add-on") for Google Sheets. This Add-on is designed to help users track their stock, crypto, and options investments by parsing transactions, matching trades, generating dashboards, summaries, and trade sheets, and handling tax implications and currency conversions. By using the Add-on, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the Add-on.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the Add-on. By installing, accessing, or using the Add-on, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. We may update these Terms from time to time, and your continued use constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 mb-3">2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Add-on allows you to input investment transactions into a Google Sheets template. It processes these transactions to identify matching trades (e.g., pairing buys and sells), calculate open and closed positions, generate visual dashboards and summaries, and perform currency conversions and basic tax-related calculations (such as cost basis tracking). The Add-on operates within your Google Sheets environment and does not store your data externally unless explicitly stated.</p>
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The Add-on is a tool for personal use and organization. It is not a financial advisory service, tax preparation software, or investment platform. All calculations are based on user-provided data and may not account for all variables, regulations, or market changes.</p>

          <li>Maintaining the security of your Google account and any linked services.</li>
