          Privacy Policy – Portfolio Tracker
        </h1>

        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Effective Date: September 21, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to the Portfolio Tracker Add-on (the "Add-on") for Google Sheets. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Add-on. By using the Add-on, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Add-on.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-2 mb-3">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect limited personal information to provide and manage the Add-on's services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> We collect and store your email address to handle licensing, password resets, and communications related to your account. We do not share your email with any third parties, and we do not send marketing communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We do not collect or store any transaction data from your Google Sheets. All transaction data (such as stock, crypto, and options investments) is read into memory, parsed, and rendered directly into your attached Google Sheet. No data is stored externally or retained after processing.</p>
        <p>The Add-on may require access to your Google Sheets to function, but this access is limited to processing within Google's ecosystem.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-2 mb-3">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing your license and account access.</li>
          <li>Facilitating password resets.</li>
          <li>Communicating with you about your account, updates, or support issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for marketing, advertising, or any other unrelated purposes.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-2 mb-3">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your email address is used exclusively for the purposes outlined above and is not disclosed to anyone outside of Sébastien Loix, except as required by law (e.g., in response to a subpoena or court order).</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-2 mb-3">4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your email address from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mt-2 mb-3">5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
